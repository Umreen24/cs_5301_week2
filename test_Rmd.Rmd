## R Markdown
### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x <- c(20:60)
print(x)
M <- mean(x)
print("mean")
print(M)
```

Add option collapse = TRUE to put all code and output in a single display box

```{r,collapse = TRUE}
x <- c(20:60)
print(x)
M <- mean(x)
print("mean")
print(M)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure1, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter is added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
